<br>
It is an over rated extremely popular private messaging app for sharing photos and short live videos having a touch of fun elements attached with it. Snapchat works on the idea of ephemeral messaging which means once the message or snap is viewed, it will be disappeared forever.
The interesting part of Snapchat is that it is not only a photo sharing or a messaging app; you can also do marketing for your business on it as well and if you are not using it for marketing, you can still download the app to have an eye on the others to know what’s going on in the market and how others are using Snapchat precisely for their business.
We can say with over 100 million active users daily, Snapchat is the future of social media.
